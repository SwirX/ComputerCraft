# SX-Music

A music player and downloader

There is a download function that downloads the song and convert it to dfpwm to be played by the computer

# How to download
go to your computer and run
`pastebin get https://pastebin.com/f7LG9sZV SXMusic_Installer.lua`
then when downloaded run it using
`SXMusic_Installer.lua`

but you need python and some of it libraries in order for the downloader to work.
If you don't have python nor it libraries enter the second option when running the ```install.lua``` file
else you can just proceed with the default settings
